1. By Industry 

   1. BPO
      
      Over 20 years ago, outsourcing business processes hit a critical mass of acceptance. Companies that successfully outsourced application maintenance work realized they could bring similar savings to business operations. A line of uninterrupted growth began, and today — in India alone — the BPO industry is the country’s largest private sector employer, with a workforce of almost 3.5 million people. However, there was no secret, nor magicbehind this rapid growth. As was the case with application maintenance, the BPO business model rested on two very basic pillars: on one side, low-skill, repetitive, high volume work on the other, a large pool of low-cost, trainable workers. Up until 2014, the business model remained stable, with some shifts to more up-market work and less developed countries beginning to compete for work.

   4. Health care
   
      If you’re a healthcare provider, you’re dealing with endless paperwork and administrative tasks that sap your energies and turn your attention away from patient care. But you can get well in a hurry. Robotics Process Automation (RPA) can take on many of the burdensome tasks that clutter up your healthcare system, like:
        Managing inventory,
        Entering repetitive data,
        Digitizing patient files,
        Scheduling appointments,
        Billing patients and processing claims.
