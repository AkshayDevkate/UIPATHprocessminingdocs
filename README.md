1. By Industry 

   1. BPO
      
      Over 20 years ago, outsourcing business processes hit a critical mass of acceptance. Companies that successfully outsourced application maintenance work realized they could bring similar savings to business operations. A line of uninterrupted growth began, and today — in India alone — the BPO industry is the country’s largest private sector employer, with a workforce of almost 3.5 million people. However, there was no secret, nor magicbehind this rapid growth. As was the case with application maintenance, the BPO business model rested on two very basic pillars: on one side, low-skill, repetitive, high volume work on the other, a large pool of low-cost, trainable workers. Up until 2014, the business model remained stable, with some shifts to more up-market work and less developed countries beginning to compete for work.

   4. Health care
   
      If you’re a healthcare provider, you’re dealing with endless paperwork and administrative tasks that sap your energies and turn your attention away from patient care. But you can get well in a hurry. Robotics Process Automation (RPA) can take on many of the burdensome tasks that clutter up your healthcare system, like:
        Managing inventory,
        Entering repetitive data,
        Digitizing patient files,
        Scheduling appointments,
        Billing patients and processing claims.

   5. Manufacturing 
   
   Manufacturers already implement physical industry robots to assemble, test, and package their products. Despite these robots being able to help streamline the assembly line, the manufacturing industry still struggles to maintain control over managing its back-office and operational processes. Manufacturers must juggle labor and time-intensive processes such as customer communication, procurement, inventorymanagement and payment processing. At the same time, they have to maintain cost reduction and innovative business practices. In order to overcome these pain points, many manufacturing companies are turning to RPA to attain improved agility and more streamlined operations across the value chain, resulting in up to a 20% cost savings across various touch points.

2. By technology 
   
   1. Citrix automation 
   
   It’s a fact that many applications today are published via Citrix XenApp. A Citrix server only sends screenshots of the live application that runs on the Citrix server back to the client, so UiPath cannot access the logical elements that make up the user interface. UiPath went to great lengths to make Citrix automation possible: featuring a powerful image recognition engine that is optimized to find images on the screen in under 100 milliseconds. Besides image recognition, the text is sent back to the client via shared clipboard or by using on-screen OCR (optical character recognition). More importantly, despite the inherent difficulties of automating Citrix, you can still use the integrated recorder to achieve great productivity. In fact, it takes the same amount of time to build an integration that involves Citrix, as it takes to automate a regular desktop application.

  4. Excel automation 
  
  How could something like the venerable software Excel—perhaps the all-time champion in storing, organizing, and manipulating data—become even more efficient and productive than it already is? Excel is easy to use, accessible, and highly popular. Nonetheless, it is not always user-friendly and can at times prove to be very time-consuming and hard to integrate with other applications. For example, the established way to automate tasks in Excel requires training for you to become proficient in Visual Basic for Excel Macros. Today’s working environment is multi-application focused, with data constantly being transferred between applications. Migrating and integrating data into platforms can, therefore, become troublesome, even when you work with applications that can import and export files. This happens because information can get mixed up or lost in the process, forcing you to waste precious time by repeating the steps each time you sync the data.
